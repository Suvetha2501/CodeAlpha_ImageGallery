# CodeAlpha_ImageGallery
A simple and responsive Image Gallery Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to upload images, view them in a clean grid layout, preview images in full screen, and delete images. Uploaded images are stored locally using the browser's Local Storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
